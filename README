Tips

 1. Using embedded database for this assignment, so neither for the standalone server running or unit tests
 doesn't need any database configurations.

 2. Do Mvn clean install to build restful server. The file is called  tradeshift-task-assembly-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz
 under /modules/tradeshift-task-assembly/target.

 3. unzip the file getting from the previous step to any folder.

 4. locate to the folder, setup an environment variable called $TRADESHIFT_HOME. (export TRADESHIFT_HOME=`pwd`)

 5. run the script under bin/start-tradeshift.sh. And the server should be good to go.

 6. run the script stop-tradeshift.sh to stop the server.

 7. the logs are under var/log/
